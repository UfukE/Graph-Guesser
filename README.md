Demo at : https://Graph-Guesser.ufuke.repl.co

## Interface explanation:

- While the left canvas is displaying the current selected graph, canvas to the right displays the current prediction of the ai on the seen graph.

- Each node on the right display represents the "shape" of the graph with same order as the buttons to create graphs. 

- Train ai button, trains the ai with 100 iterations and a dataset of 100 random examples (Each time called, a new dataset is automatically initialized). 

- You may interrupt the training with the "Stop Training" button appearing while training is happening.

- You may observe some additional info about the training process on the console

- While the "no loop" button stops the animation on both canvas, the "loop" button re-activates it. 

- You may export the current ai as you wish, with using the "export AI" button. 

- This project also contains an already trained ai. You can import it using "Import trained AI"
